# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic tac toe game programmed using python considering all the cases.

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols in a row.

The players take turns placing their symbol on an empty space within the grid. One player uses X as their symbol, and the other uses O. The game continues until one player wins by forming a line of three of their symbols, or the game ends in a draw when all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won.

Tic-tac-toe is a simple game with a limited number of possible outcomes, which has led to the creation of algorithms and strategies that can determine optimal moves for each player, assuming both players play perfectly. As a result, the game often ends in a draw when both players follow the optimal strategy. It's commonly used as a teaching tool for basic game theory and critical thinking skills.
